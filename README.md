# GiphyAPI
This project was a homework due for the Trilogy & University of Arizona Coding Bootcamp. This project was intended to hone my skills in
 * HTML
 * CSS
 * Javascript
 * jQuery
 * Ajax

The homework for this project instructed me to construct an application that will render gifs provided by Giphy.
 1. User has the ability to create additional topic buttons with the input button.
 2. Once a new topic button has been added, it will be updated automatically.
 3. User can click on existing topic buttons to reveal a list of 10 gifs with the according topic.
 4. The gifs that render will initially be still. A user will have the ability to make them move when they click on a gif.
 5. Gifs can also be paused as user clicks on a moving gif.
